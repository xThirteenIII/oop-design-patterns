Singleton is a creational design pattern, which ensures that only one object of its kind exists
and provides a single point of access to it for any other code.

Singleton has almost the same pros and cons as global variables. 
Although they’re super-handy, they break the modularity of your code.

You can’t just use a class that depends on a Singleton in some other context, without carrying over the Singleton to the other context. 
Most of the time, this limitation comes up during the creation of unit tests.
