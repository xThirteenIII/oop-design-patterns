State is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change the behavior when its internal state changes.
The pattern extracts state-related behaviors into separate state classes and forces the original object to 
delegate the work to an instance of these classes, instead of acting on its own.

Usage examples: The State pattern is commonly used in C++ to convert massive switch-base state machines into objects.

Identification: State pattern can be recognized by methods that change their behavior depending on the objectsâ€™ state, 
controlled externally.
